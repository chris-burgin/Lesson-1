# Lesson 1
- Install Node using [NVM](https://stackoverflow.com/documentation/node.js/2823/nvm-node-version-manager#t=201609021942075052739)
- Install GIT
- Work on Node Example in `example/unfinished`
- Save to Github 

## Stuff to do this week
- Read Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 from [Up & Going](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20&%20going/README.md#you-dont-know-js-up--going) in the [You Dont Know JS Series](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)
- Work through this example again and review it.

The plan is to read the entire You Dont Know JS Books in the next 8 weeks. If you can read these books and understand them you could be hired as a javascript developer almost anywhere. They are easy to read and cover so much!
